<p>Its a movie based on how an enthusiastic girl changes the life of a boy fed up from his daily work. Later the boy falls in love with her but she thinks she loves someone else. The boy helps her to meet her lover and then returns back to his home with a complete change in his personality leading to immense growth of his company. Later he gets to know that the girl is working in a school as her lover rejects her. He then goes to meet her and brings her back to her home.
